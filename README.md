# Twitter-Bot
Quick Project to create a Twitter bot using Twitter's Developer tools and the tweepy API to send out automated information about Bitcoin and ETH using the Yahoo Finance API library (yfinance).

I decided to add some files that walk through step by step some of the features I used with the Twitter-Bot file, including Yahoo API and Yahoo Scraping Code. Although the Twitter-Bot.py is the only program controlling the bot.
